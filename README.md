This is an Excel and Tableau project for anlysis of Road accident over a period of two years. The project is for analysing and visualizing insight about the accident data for data driven decisions.

**_Disclaimer_** : _All datasets and reports do not represent any company or institution or country. its just a dummy dataset to demostrate the power of Excel_



## Concepts Applied.
* Excel Data cleaning and Visualization
* Tableau skill visualization skills

## Data Processing 
The major data processing steps applied where creating of the month and year column using
`=Text(value,”MMM”)` for the Month column and
`=Text(value, “YYYY”)` for the Year column. The data was faily clean.


## Analysis Tasks

* Total Casualties after Accidents.
* Total Casualties and percentage of total with respect to severity and maximum casualties by type of Vehicle.
* Total Casualties with respect to Vehicle Type.
* Monthly trend showing comparison of previous and current year.
* Maximum Casualties by Road Type.
* Distribution of Total Casualties by Road surface.
* Relationship between casualties by location/by area and by day and Night.

## Interesting Features of the Dashboard. 
* The dashboard is a very interactive one with timeline and slicers for interacting with it.
* Icons on left pane, except for the first on the top has link. you can see the table below to understand better.

 ## Conclution and Recommendation
 From the dashboard, there is a low percentage of fatal causualities which is fair. I have also observed that we have more accident cases for car users which occurs mainly during the dry season and in the day time. This could be because dry season is favourable for car use which could increase use of private cars and Traffic congestion. I would suggest that the goverment create linking roads and people are encouraged to use public transport.
